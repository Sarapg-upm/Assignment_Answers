Before talking abour the next steps for searching orthologs, I would like to point out that a better study could be performed if
the two database to compare were have been of the same nature, nucleotides or aminoacids. When we do  the transcrtiption and
translation of a nucleotides sequence is performed, at the end the same aminoacid sequence can be obtained, but when we have
to change from an aminoacid sequence to a nucleotide, what codon would be the correct one? I think that a homogeneous data
for such as complex theme could be a better starting of the problem.

Next steps proposed would be:
1. Generate an alignment file with clustalo and then a tree (in example, with iqtree) for studying the phylogenetics of the orhtologs
2. This tree could be studied for example with the tool etetoolkit http://etetoolkit.org/ (sorry is python)
3. We could also study the order of the gene in the genome for seeing if there is any conservation along the gene orther in species.
4. Another step could be to search for networks of orthologos groups, which are groups of reciprocal best hits also name as clusters of orthologs groups.
5. Searching in orthologs database like KEGG ortholog database, or orthobd.
